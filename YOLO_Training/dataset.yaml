# Train and validation image directories (relative to 'path')
train: images/train
val: images/val

# Optional: test images directory
# test: images/test

# ============================================
# IMPORTANT: After running convert_json_to_yolo.py,
# a new dataset.yaml will be generated automatically
# with the correct class names from your dataset.
# Use that generated file instead of this template.
